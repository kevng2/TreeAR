# Tree AR
An Android application that helps users visualize what a tree would look like in their backyard.

# What I Learned
- Implemented Google ARCore and rendered models using the Android Camera
- Implemented the Poly API to let users search and load models dynamically
- Used Square's Retrofit library to send requests to the Poly API and retrieve JSON
- Followed the Material Design guidelines to improve the UI
